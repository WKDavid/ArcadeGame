# Remastered arcade game frogger

In this project I've taken the classic arcade Frogger game to the Star Wars thematic universe.
As soon as you start the game, a welcoming screen will introduce you to the basic mechanics.
On the same screen, you will be able to choose a difficulty level and your ship.
Once you click a ship, the game will start.

## History

I've written this project as a part of Front End Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
I've modified the HTML and CSS to my needs, but my **primary goal** was to write **_Javascript_**, that would run the game.
Additionally, I ended up restyling the game completely and adding several new features to  it.

## Features:

+ Welcoming screen introduces you to the game world and helps you dive into it's atmosphere.    
+ **Multiple** options for game difficulty.
+ The game is totally flexible among all known screen sizes.
+ To control a space ship player can use not only keyboard arrow keys, but also on screen buttons.
+ The game supports mobile devices and touch screens.
+ Endgame congratulation messages are styled accordingly to a player's ship choice in the beginning.
